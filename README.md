# shelfisizer
Open-source modular synthesizer designs. Developed in the Audio Lab at NYU Tandon's program in Integrated Design & Media.

The Shelfisizer is an open-source project by R. Luke DuBois inspired by Serge modular systems as well as hybrid analog synthesis / microcontroller systems such as the Buchla 200e. These modules use Arduino or Arduino-compatible microcontrollers and monolithic IC chips to handle much of the logic that definies the module’s behavior, leaving analog components for the parts of the modules that actually generate analog signals. The use of microcontrollers makes it simple to prototype modules that require an understanding of “state”, such as pattern memory or hysteresis, and the use of CMOS ICs allows for a design that has a much lower part count than typical analog synthesizer modules.
